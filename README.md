This is a sample-project that is created using PHP using the Pecee-framework.

### Quick checklist ###

- Projects is placed inside the folder app/[NAME-OF-PROJECT].

- Configuration is placed inside the folder app/[NAME-OF-PROJECT]/config

- You can add as many projects as you like.

- Namespace should be the same as app folder name and can be changed directly from config.php (app/[NAME-OF-PROJECT]/config/config.php)

- Point the webserver to the www folder of the app you would like to be accesible from the web (example app/Demo/www/).

Open source MVC PHP framework based on Microsoft MVVM.

Features:

- Fully customisable template engine. Overwrite render() method to add your own templating engine or create your own using the Taglib class.

- Every template has class, called a Widget, behind it. From here you can set properties, create methods and you can even render widgets inside a widget - this makes it super easy the create small pieces of functionality, that can be reused wherever you like.

- Because every template is basiclly a class, you can extend functionality from other widgets and reuse the same functionality or overwrite the things you want to change.

- Don't like something? Everything is 100% object oriented, so every little piece of code can be easily extended. A great example is PeceeCamp which uses some of the functionality of PeceeCamp, but completely rewrites the way routing is working.
